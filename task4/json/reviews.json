    "description": "Absolutely obsessed with this place! A very cozy place in East Village for pandan matcha, pandan lattes, and pastries. Everything was beautifully decorated, with cute seating by the window. I wanna come back here with a book on a rainy day.The pandan matcha (I've tried it both cold and warm) is lovely. You can definitely taste the pandan. Excited to try the latte next. My boyfriend enjoyed his cold brew as well. And we both loved our pastries (almond croissant and tomato, feta, spinach turnover). This will definitely be our new local neighborhood spot!",

    "description": "Great drinks! I like the Tahini (Black Sesame) latte here. This time got earl grey latte...it's okay (3.5 stars/5 for it...it was good but not 5 stars, not sure if it's tea brand or the ratio of tea to milk or maybe almond milk they use doesn't go well with earl grey?). Tahini Latte def one of my favorites here. The girl in front of me got it too. They have a variety of pastries and croffles. Didn't try them so cannot comment on it. Baristas were nice even though they're busy. Very popular place. 3 group of friends can be in there at the same time. Tables are close so you can hear other people's conversations easily...it is a small cozy place afterall. Great place to come, chat and catch up over coffee. Don't come if you have homework or need quiet place to study or read. Drink + almond milk = $6.80 (as of March 2023, next year's pricing? Who knows with this inflation lol) enjoy it for this price while you can, definitely a place worth checking out hence 5 star review.",

I walked over not thinking much of it but walking in I saw they make fresh croffles (croissant waffle) and have a specialty tiramisu latte. I ordered a chocolate and strawberry croffle and the iced tiramisu latte. The croffles are freshly made, and you can definitely tell. They were seriously amazing. The whipped cream was delicious and topped with fresh strawberries and chocolate drizzle. The waffle was perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. My tiramisu latte was also out of this world! The layering is beautiful and it genuinely tasted like tiramisu. The employee was really friendly and made my latte quickly. I seriously can't believe I found this place so late, I will be coming here way more often!!",

    "description": "My friends and I were exploring the area and were in much need of some caffeine and a place to rest our tired legs. We stopped by Kor\u00e9 Coffee, which turned out to be a pretty popular spot!The Tiramisu Latte piqued my interest as tiramisu is one of my top favorite desserts. However, it was a pricey cup of coffee for sure (almost $10 with tip). It was a solid drink, but I've had a better Tiramisu Latte in a cafe near my hometown for cheaper. For start, I wish the coffee was a little stronger. I understand that the cocoa powder is a nod to the famous Italian dessert, but I thought that it added an unpleasant texture. Cocoa powder doesn't dissolve easily, so it did taste a little chalky. In traditional preparation of tiramisu, the cocoa powder has time to hydrate in the cream, whereas in latte form, it does not receive the same time treatment.While the coffee shop is small, there is some space if you want to get some work/studying done, or socialize with a small group of friends. However, there is no public restroom available, although the barista did recommend me where to find one nearby.",

    "description": "It breaks my heart to say this, but I found that the matcha here was on the weaker side. My hot matcha latte tasted more like milk than match, which does not make it a worthwhile visit for me. Excuse the pastry, this is the only picture I got of my drink!Regardless, this cafe is truly beautiful. The vibe is great (though I don't believe they have any seating) and the staff is friendly. I was the only person in, so had relatively no wait time. I had heard great reviews of their matcha for so long, so I was pretty disappointed when it didn't stick out at all. They do seem to prepare it very fresh which is great, there's nothing worse than pre-made matcha syrup! I just think the measurements may have been off for my drink. I won't discourage anyone from going, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit.",

My food was probably ready for a good 40 minutes but no one said anything. Went up to the register and the lady told me it was ready on the app so...where was it? It was hiding on the side behind the counter. I never received a ready notification anywhere. Anyways, that system is pretty shitty as they'll sometimes call names out and then won't. As such, food was mediocre. Gyudon was about $18 after tax. It had a lot of rice and onion and was just overall really mushy. Might have been the fact that it was just sitting there but I grade things as I receive them. The matcha latte was ok but cost me about $8 for the smallest serving which is fine depending on the quality of matcha used. I heard their coffee is supposedly good but never got the chance to try it. Good work space with wifi and environment but gets extremely busy during lunch. Not sure if I would come by here again in the future since it seems to be a hot mess.",

The location around the area has some cute spots but is mostly under constructions as of now, but doesn't impact the ambiance of this place. There are many outlets located around the area along with couches and desks to work. It's fairly quiet in the weekday mornings so you can definitely come by and take calls, but it does pick up in the afternoon and gets quite busy. The coffee is decent- matcha is not the best in my opinion. Would definitely get the food here though as it tastes super homemade and authentic. The noodles and the bulgogi both make for a great afternoon lunch. Would definitely come back to do work or just catch up with someone!",

It provided such a nice textural contrast. The outside of the cookie was crispy, and the inside was somewhat gooey and chewy. The chocolate was semisolid. It was a little bit too sweet for my preferences though, but it's a perfect pairing with a coffee or tea. The matcha latte was okay. It wasn't the strongest matcha I've had, but the taste of the matcha was there. There was ample amount of foam, and the temperature was perfect. There was some unwhisked matcha at the bottom of the cup though.It's not the best cookie I've had, but it is pretty good. I'm glad I decided to stop by to try it at least once.",

Once it was mixed through though, it had a nice floral and slight cherry flavor to it.My friend ordered the Deconstructed Latte, which had such a fun presentation. The downside: she said she could pretty much predict what the flavors were before drinking it, and it felt like the deconstruction wasn't as \"special\" as she had hoped. The presentation was more for the photo op than anything else, and it might be better to just get a regular latte next time.",

The place is small with just three tables for couples, a bench for two, and a small barstool seating. Those that come, do like to linger and take it slow with their drinks. The deconstructed latte was all about presentation. You get three glasses including a shot of espresso, some milk ($1 extra for oat milk), and then a latte. Also comes with sparkling water as a palate cleanser and wafer/pizzelle. The espresso is strong & bitter, milk is basic, and the latte was decent. I had the impression this comes deconstructed but I'd be mixing items together to make the latte. Instead, it's just 3 items giving you the chance to taste them separately. (Approx $12-14) While ascetically pleasing to the eye, I'd probably just order a latte in a mug instead for under $6.They sell various pastries (including a few vegan options & some gluten free) as well as some breakfast like food items (toast). You can also purchase their coffee and some merch. There is a water jug near the front to refill your glass. I managed to find a power plugin there to charge my phone. No restrooms.",

Book Club is open almost all day long - from morning till midnight, 7 days a week - serving not only as a bookstore, but also as a laptop-friendly caf\u00e9 during the day, and a laptop-free lounge, music, and events space in the evenings. Indeed, when I stopped by recently, plenty of folks were in on the secret, typing away at their laptops in the bar or in a cozier living room-like area in the rear. Laptop loiterers should note that there is a 90-minute time limit during the day, subject to a purchase. There's not only coffee, but also beer, wine, and snacks here. The outdoor parklet is also a good space to meet and chat with folks over a coffee or beer, although, this being ultra-dense New York, you should not expect any privacy when it comes to your conversation. I stopped by recently to rehydrate (over a beer, of course) while on a walk through the neighborhood and, after overhearing sensitive HR information from one party and TMI relationship details from another, promptly put on my headphones as I typed away more Yelp reviews on my phone.",

As you settle into the warmth of the surroundings, you can't help but feel a sense of joy and contentment. Although, it could use a little more attention to detail, like the addition of a fake fire to enhance the ambiance.As you wander towards the bathrooms, you'll notice that they are gender-free, but that can be a bit confusing. The mirrors are positioned in such a way that you may catch the eyes of passersby, which can create an awkward atmosphere. It's not comfortable to be alone in there with a man present.Despite the slight discomfort, the experience is made even better by the delicious coffee, especially the mocha. Even though it's not the ideal spot for work, many people can still be found at the coffee bar typing away on their computers, sporting the quintessential New Yorker vibes. Books are very unique and offer a wide variety of international writers and hard to find books.",

The store is located on the lower east side of Manhattan and is near many restaurants and local hot spots such as Tompkins Square Park and the iconic Jewish deli, Katz Delicatessen. The coffee is very rich and the wine is tasty as well. Overall the store is a great place for booklovers and students to come and work, read, and potentially network. What brought me to the store was the vibe. I was looking for a place to study when I stumbled across this jewel. I ordered a cup of coffee, which was delicious. I just wish they had more options. I took a seat in a very comfortable brown leather chair, which reminded me of my grandfather's chair. The walls were covered with books, placed on heavy oak wood bookshelves and the store felt almost whimsical and very chill.

Our food and drinks were good nothing too special. I enjoyed my espresso martini and the fries/brussel sprouts that we shared. I appreciate how patient they were with my friend and I.

Would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting New York, especially since they don't have another US location! (as of yet, there's an LA location coming soon!)",

There was a line out the door around 3pm on Sunday but the folks in front of us slowly kept leaving. Once we made it to the register, the gal told us there'd be a 30 minute wait. It seems like they took on more orders (possibly online too) than they could push out.Well, that didn't stop me. I placed an order for a matcha latte and hub ordered the Kyoto latte. We went out for a quick 20 minute walk and drinks looked to have been ready for a while.Hands down, the most thick, rich, and luxurious tasting matcha I have ever tasted. I requested it to be sweetened which she mentioned there would be simple syrup to add at the counter. However, upon first sip, it didn't require it. It was lightly sweetened and perfect! I hope to make another pit stop in Brooklyn to grab one more cup. Cheers!",

    "description": "I've been on the constant search for a pastry place that has kouign amanns in NY, and have had difficulty finding any. However, I was happy to find this coffee shop after looking online for places that sold kouign amanns! Not only do they have good kouign amanns (especially if you're able to reheat them up in the oven for a few minutes for ultimate flakiness), but their other pastries are pretty delicious and so is their coffee. I am a big fan of their Spanish and Kyoto latte. It has just the subtlest hint of sweetness to pair with the overall boldness of the coffee. The milk The overall aesthetic of the coffee shop is also pretty awesome! Overall very modern and chic. I will say though, sometimes the line does get super long so if it's a weekend morning, I would try to go earlier if you can. Seats are also limited, but if you're not able to snag a seat, you always have the option of just walking outside and enjoying your coffee and/or pastry with a beautiful view of the Manhattan skyline!",

    "description": "Located in the downtown Brooklyn near the waterfront, this Kyoto-originated coffee shop is definitely worth a visit! I love the whole aesthetics of their store design and both service and coffees are great! If you're new to the neighborhood, take a walk to Dumbo and the waterfront for one of the best skyline views of Manhattan!",
